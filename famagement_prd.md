  - **Sarah (Parent/Organizer):** Manages family calendar, finances, wants oversight without micromanaging
  - **Mike (Parent/Contributor):** Needs quick task access, location sharing, budget visibility
  - **Teen Emma:** Wants independence with guardrails, allowance tracking, task completion rewards

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption:** 10K active families in first 6 months
- **Engagement:** 5+ sessions per family per week
- **Retention:** 70% monthly active user retention
- **AI Usage:** 60% of families use AI co-pilot weekly
- **Privacy Score:** 100% data remains user-controlled (self-hosted or E2EE)
